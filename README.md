# SAIC-Schedule

This is simple Full-Stack Web application which shows the Time Schedule for the semester. 
All the input are inserted through the input bar and displayed on the same webpage.

Initially created as a front-end project, however I realized there needs to be better way of maintaining the data. 
Hence I decided to develop this project into a Full-Stack web application.

You can still visit the Front-End Application through the initial commit - I used HTML, CSS and Javascript (jQuery).

Currently WIP.
